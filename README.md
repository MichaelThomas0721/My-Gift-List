# My Gift List

My gift list is a website that I created because my family kept buying the
same gifts for peoples birthdays, this fixes that problem by letting users
make items as taken so that other users know not to purchase that gift.

This repository is a complete rewrite of the previous (now archived) NextJs version of the website.

The code is open source :)

## Setup

Before you start, you need to install all the node packages that come with the template.
```bash

To start the dev server run the following
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
